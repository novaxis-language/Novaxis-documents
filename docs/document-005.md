# Comments in Novaxis

## Introduction
Comments in Novaxis are used to add explanatory notes or remarks within the code that are not meant to be executed. They are helpful for documenting the code and providing context to other developers or yourself in the future. Novaxis supports single-line comments that start with // or #.

## Single-Line Comments

To create a single-line comment in Novaxis, simply start the line with // or #. Anything written after // or # on the same line will be considered a comment and will not be executed by the interpreter.
```PHP
// This is a single-line comment in Novaxis
# This is another single-line comment
```

## Example:
```PHP
name ? String = John Doe // This is a variable declaration with a comment
age ? Number = 30 # Another variable declaration with a comment
// Another single-line comment
```
In the example above, we have two variable declarations with comments and one blank line with a comment. The comments provide additional information about the purpose of the lines.

## Benefits of Comments
- **Code Documentation**: Comments help in documenting the code, making it easier for other developers to understand its purpose and functionality.
- **Code Readability**: Comments provide context and explanations, making the code more readable and maintainable.
- **Debugging**: Comments can help in debugging by providing insights into the thought process and logic behind the code.
- **Future Reference**: Comments serve as a reference for future modifications or enhancements to the code.

Remember to use comments wisely and keep them up-to-date as the code evolves. Well-commented code can make a significant difference in the maintainability and readability of your Novaxis programs.
