# Datatypes in Novaxis

## Introduction

In Novaxis, data types define the nature of the values stored in variables. Novaxis supports various data types, allowing you to represent different kinds of information in your data structure. Understanding these data types is essential for effectively working with Novaxis and ensuring your data is correctly structured.

## Datatypes
1. **String**:
Strings in Novaxis are sequences of characters, such as letters, numbers, and symbols. They are used to represent textual data. In Novaxis, strings are declared without enclosing them in quotes, making it easy to work with text directly. For example:
	```PHP
	name ? String = John Doe
	message ? String = Hello, Novaxis!
	```

2. **Number**:
Numbers in Novaxis represent numeric values, including integers and floating-point numbers. Novaxis supports both positive and negative numbers. Numeric values can be directly assigned to variables without any additional syntax. For example:
	```PHP
	age ? Number = 30
  	pi ? Number = 3.14159
  	```
3. **Boolean**:
Booleans are data types with only two possible values: true or false. They are used to represent binary conditions, such as yes/no or on/off states. Booleans are straightforward to use in Novaxis:
	```PHP
 	is_student ? Boolean = true
	is_working ? Boolean = false
 	```
